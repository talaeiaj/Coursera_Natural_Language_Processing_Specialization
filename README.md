# Deep Learning Specialization - Coursera


![](/resources/Certification.png)

This repository contains my coursework and projects completed during the [Natural Language Processing Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/natural-language-processing) offered by DeepLearning.AI. 

The NLP Specialization is an in-depth program designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of the core concepts and techniques in Natural Language Processing. Through a combination of theory and hands-on projects, the specialization equips learners with the knowledge and skills required to solve real-world problems using NLP.
